I made this simple React app for my personal use since I kept forgetting whether I had updated my attendance earlier this day or not. This resulted in erroneous calculation of my attendance percentage. So whenever I update my attendance for that day, I would just click the button and it will display "Attendance updated". And after the end of the day, the text disappears and it will be like I need to update the attendance everyday for exactly one time.
