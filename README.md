I made a simple React app for my personal use since I kept forgetting whether I'd updated my attendance for a particular day earlier that day or not. This resulted in erroneous calculation of my attendance percentage. So whenever I update my attendance for a particular day, I'll check the button and at the end of the day, the text disappears. That means I'd to update my attendance everyday for exactly one time. I added the functionality to many tasks other than attendance with a few extra features.
