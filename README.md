I made this React app for my personal use to prevent compulsive checking of mails. So whenever I would check my mail once early that day, I would just check the checkbox in the app and whenever I feel like checking mail again, I would just open that app to prevent this behaviour. The checkbox unchecks itself if a new day begins.
